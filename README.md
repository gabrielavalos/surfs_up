# Purpose
#### The Purpose of this analysis is to determine if the island of Oahu is the best one to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop. With this analysis, we hope to inform W. Avy of the temperatures and precipitation on the island, so he can determine if it is a suitable investment.
# Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
### Additional Queries
#### 1. An additional beneficial query is filtering out the precipitation for the months of june and december, which would be with the following code: CODE
#### and would provide the following results.
#### 2. Another beneficial query would be running a filter to show the prescipitaion for each moth and then getting the statistics for each. This would help really determine the dryest months - which usually means high surfing activity. That query would be run with the following code.
